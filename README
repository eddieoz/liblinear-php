INTRODUCTION

Liblinear is an solver for SVM large classification and regression problems for big data. The liblinear extension wraps this in a PHP module for easy use in PHP scripts. The extension requires PHP 5.3 or above.

Liblinear PHP module was developed to solve a problem when predicting a large classification data by streaming, using big data, cloud and Internet.

From original project, liblinear-1.92, we imported 3 files to got working: linear.h, tron.h and linear.cpp. This must be presented on the project directory to be compiled with.

INSTALLATION

You need Liblinear for training your models, before predicting with PHP.
Install it from: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/

# phpize
# configure --enable-liblinear
# make
# sudo make install

USAGE

This version only enable predicting, using probability from regression solvers or not.

The function: OZ_predict ( '<predict_line>', '<model>', probability_flag 0|1 );


EXAMPLE

<?php

$stdin = fopen('php://stdin', 'r');

while ($buffer = fgets($stdin)) {
        $result = OZ_predict( $buffer, "tests/test.model", 0);

?>

It will receive data from stdin (ex: cat predict.svm | php liblinear.php ) and try to predict that.

You will find more usage examples at tests/ and contrib/ directory.
